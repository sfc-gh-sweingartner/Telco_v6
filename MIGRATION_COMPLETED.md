---

## üöÄ Next Steps

### 1. Launch Your App

**Access your app in Snowsight:**
1. Navigate to: Projects ‚Üí Streamlit
2. Click on "Network Optimisation" app
3. **First launch will take 2-5 minutes** while:
   - Container image builds
   - Python 3.11 environment is created
   - Packages are downloaded from PyPI
   - Dependencies are installed with uv
   - Streamlit app starts

**Subsequent launches:** 10-30 seconds (cached container)

### 2. Test All Features

Verify these work correctly:
- [ ] Main dashboard loads
- [ ] Executive KPI metrics display
- [ ] AI Insights page works
- [ ] Customer Profile page works
- [ ] **Cell Tower Lookup** - 3D maps with PyDeck (uses Mapbox) ‚≠ê
- [ ] **Geospatial Analysis** - Heat maps and overlays (uses Mapbox) ‚≠ê
- [ ] Predictive Analytics page works
- [ ] AI Network Assistant works
- [ ] Snowflake Intelligence page works

**Pay special attention to maps** - they should render with tiles, not blank white.

### 3. Monitor Performance

Watch for:
- Initial build time (~2-5 minutes) ‚è±
- App responsiveness
- Query execution times
- Map tile loading speed

### 4. Check Compute Pool

```sql
-- Check pool status
DESCRIBE COMPUTE POOL TELCO_STREAMLIT_POOL;

-- Check app status
SHOW STREAMLITS LIKE 'OMNOPM_OLUQ7ORZM';

-- Describe app configuration
DESCRIBE STREAMLIT OMNOPM_OLUQ7ORZM;
```

## üéØ What Changed

### Before (Warehouse Runtime)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited Streamlit versions
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Anaconda packages only
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited cache support

- ‚úÖ Fast initial startup

### After (SPCS Container Runtime)
- ‚úÖ Latest Streamlit (>=1.49)
- ‚úÖ Any PyPI package
- ‚úÖ Full cache support
- ‚úÖ 3-day keep-alive
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Slower first startup (2-5 min)
- ‚úÖ Fast subsequent startups (10-30s)

Query Warehouse: MYWH
External Access: ["PYPI_ACCESS_INTEGRATION","MAPBOX_ACCESS_INTEGRATION"]
Main File: main.py
Default Packages: python==3.11.*,snowflake-snowpark-python,streamlit
```

## üêõ If You Encounter Issues

### App Takes Too Long to Start
**Expected:** 2-5 minutes for first build  
**Action:** Wait patiently. Check compute pool has available nodes.

### Maps Don't Display
**Symptom:** Blank white rectangles where maps should be  
**Check:**
1. MAPBOX_ACCESS_INTEGRATION is in app config ‚úì (verified)
2. Open browser console (F12) - look for network errors
3. Check if tiles.mapbox.com is being blocked

**Fix:** Should work since integration is properly configured.

### App Won't Start
**Symptom:** Error message or indefinite loading  
**Check:**
1. Compute pool is IDLE or ACTIVE ‚úì (verified as IDLE)
2. PyPI integration exists ‚úì (verified)
3. pyproject.toml is in source location ‚úì (exists)

### Package Installation Fails
**Symptom:** Build error mentioning package not found  
**Check:**
1. PYPI_ACCESS_INTEGRATION is enabled ‚úì (verified)
2. Package exists on PyPI
3. Package supports Python 3.11

## üìä Expected Timelines

| Action | Expected Time |
|--------|--------------|
| First app launch | 2-5 minutes |
| Container build | 1-2 minutes |
| Package installation | 1-2 minutes |
| App startup | 10-30 seconds |
| Subsequent launches | 10-30 seconds |
| Map tile load | 1-3 seconds |
| Query execution | Same as before |

---

## üí∞ Cost Considerations

### Compute Pool
- **Charged:** Per-node based on CPU_X64_XS pricing
- **Active:** Only when app is running
- **Auto-suspend:** 10 minutes after last activity
- **Keep-alive:** App runs for 3 days after last user

### Warehouse (Same as Before)
- **Charged:** Per-second billing on MYWH
- **Use:** SQL query execution only
- **Not affected:** Migration doesn't change warehouse usage

### Optimization Tips
- Monitor compute pool usage
- Adjust MIN_NODES if needed (currently 2)
- Set AUTO_SUSPEND_SECS shorter if desired
- Manually shutdown app if not in use

## üéì Key Learnings

### External Access Integrations
**Two are required, not one:**
1. **PyPI** - Build time (installing packages)
2. **Mapbox** - Runtime (loading maps)

Both must be present in app configuration, even if you think you don't need them.

### Container Lifecycle
```
Build Time:
‚îú‚îÄ Allocate compute pool node
‚îú‚îÄ Create Python 3.11 environment
‚îú‚îÄ Download from PyPI (needs pypi_access_integration)
‚îú‚îÄ Install dependencies
‚îî‚îÄ Start app

Runtime:
‚îú‚îÄ User navigates to page
‚îú‚îÄ Page loads map component
‚îú‚îÄ Request tiles from Mapbox (needs mapbox_access_integration)
‚îî‚îÄ Map renders
```

### Python Version
- **Fixed at 3.11** - Cannot be changed for SPCS
- **Any package works** - Not limited to Anaconda
- **pyproject.toml** - Preferred for dependency management
