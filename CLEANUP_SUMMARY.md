# 🧹 Cleanup and Documentation Update Summary

**Date**: October 6, 2025  
**Action**: Cleaned up obsolete files and updated all documentation to reflect current deployment approach

---

## ✅ What Was Done

### 1. Moved Obsolete Files to Trash

Created `/Trash/` folder and moved:

#### Old Mapbox Setup (Warehouse Runtime)
- ❌ `Setup/mapbox_access_setup.sql`
- ❌ `Setup/connectMapBoxNoKey.sql`

**Why:** These were for the old warehouse-based Streamlit runtime. SPCS uses different external access integrations, and we now use **Carto basemaps** (public, no auth) instead of Mapbox.

#### Failed SQL App Creation Scripts
- ❌ `Setup/spcs_migration/00_RUN_ALL_MIGRATION_STEPS.sql`
- ❌ `Setup/spcs_migration/03_create_streamlit_app_spcs.sql`
- ❌ `Setup/spcs_migration/03_migrate_existing_app.sql`
- ❌ `Setup/spcs_migration/04_create_new_app_v6.sql`

**Why:** Creating SPCS Streamlit apps via SQL doesn't work well:
- UI doesn't show SQL-created apps properly
- Git integration and stage setup isn't handled correctly
- **Must use Snowsight UI** for SPCS app creation (works perfectly!)

#### Old Documentation
- ❌ `MIGRATION_COMPLETED.md`

**Why:** Early migration docs that are now outdated. Better docs now exist.

### 2. Updated All Documentation

#### Main README (`README.md`)
**Changes:**
- ✅ Quick Start now shows UI-based deployment (not SQL)
- ✅ SPCS section updated with current approach
- ✅ All Mapbox references changed to Carto
- ✅ External access integrations explained clearly
- ✅ Project structure updated to show Trash folder
- ✅ Key design decisions updated (Carto, SPCS runtime)

**Before:**
```sql
-- Old: SQL-based app creation
@Setup/spcs_migration/03_create_streamlit_app_spcs.sql
```

**After:**
```
Must create app via Snowsight UI
See CREATE_APP_IN_SNOWSIGHT.md for instructions
```

#### Quick Create Guide (`QUICK_CREATE_GUIDE.md`)
**Changes:**
- ✅ Clarified PYPI_ACCESS_INTEGRATION purpose
- ✅ Changed "Mapbox integration" to "Carto map tiles"
- ✅ Added note about Carto being public (no API key)
- ✅ Updated testing checklist to mention Carto basemap
- ✅ Added troubleshooting reference to MAPBOX_FIX_SUMMARY.md

#### Trash Folder Documentation (`Trash/README.md`)
**Created new file:**
- ✅ Explains what's in Trash
- ✅ Documents why each file was obsolete
- ✅ Points to current approach
- ✅ Clarifies files are kept for reference, not deletion

### 🗑️ Trash Folder

**Files moved but kept for reference:**
```

## 🔄 Key Changes in Approach

### Deployment Method
**Before:**
- ❌ Create app via SQL
- ❌ Complex ROOT_LOCATION and Git stage setup
- ❌ App not visible in Snowsight UI

**After:**
- ✅ Create app via Snowsight UI
- ✅ UI handles Git integration automatically
- ✅ App immediately visible and manageable

### Map Technology
**Before:**
- ❌ Mapbox (requires auth, complex setup)
- ❌ Limited network rule (5 hosts)
- ❌ API key management

**After:**
- ✅ Carto basemaps (public, no auth)
- ✅ Expanded network rule (19 hosts)
- ✅ Zero configuration needed
- ✅ Fast, reliable global CDN

### External Access
**Before:**
- Minimal documentation
- Unclear what each integration does

**After:**
- ✅ Clear explanation in README
- ✅ PYPI_ACCESS_INTEGRATION - for package installation
- ✅ MAPBOX_ACCESS_INTEGRATION - for Carto tiles (misnomer but kept)
- ✅ Visual diagram in EXTERNAL_ACCESS_DIAGRAM.md

## 📝 Updated Terminology

| Old Term | New Term | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| "Mapbox integration" | "Carto map tiles" | Still uses MAPBOX_ACCESS_INTEGRATION name |
| "SQL app creation" | "Snowsight UI creation" | Only method that works |
| "Migration" | "Deployment" | Not migrating, deploying fresh |
| "API key" | "No API key needed" | Carto is public |

---

## 🎯 What Users Need to Know

### For New Deployments:

1. **Run setup scripts** (3 files):
   ```sql
   @Setup/spcs_migration/01_create_compute_pool.sql
   @Setup/spcs_migration/02_create_external_access_integrations.sql
   @Setup/spcs_migration/05_fix_mapbox_access.sql
   ```

2. **Create app in Snowsight UI** (not SQL):
   - Follow `CREATE_APP_IN_SNOWSIGHT.md`
   - Select "Run on container"
   - Enable both external access integrations

3. **Maps use Carto** (public basemap):
   - No API key needed
   - Automatically works with external access integration
   - Fast, reliable, free

### For Troubleshooting:

- **Maps blank?** → `MAPBOX_FIX_SUMMARY.md`
- **Build fails?** → Check PYPI_ACCESS_INTEGRATION enabled
- **App creation?** → `CREATE_APP_IN_SNOWSIGHT.md`
- **Quick reference?** → `QUICK_CREATE_GUIDE.md`

3. ✅ Enable both external access integrations
4. ✅ Delete old warehouse-based app when ready

### If you're updating from Git:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Cleanup: Move obsolete files to Trash, update docs for Carto basemaps"
git push origin main
```
