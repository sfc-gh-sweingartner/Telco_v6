#  Cleanup and Documentation Update Summary

**Date**: October 6, 2025  
**Action**: Cleaned up obsolete files and updated all documentation to reflect current deployment approach

---

##  What Was Done

### 1. Moved Obsolete Files to Trash

Created `/Trash/` folder and moved:

#### Old Mapbox Setup (Warehouse Runtime)
-  `Setup/mapbox_access_setup.sql`
-  `Setup/connectMapBoxNoKey.sql`

**Why:** These were for the old warehouse-based Streamlit runtime. SPCS uses different external access integrations, and we now use **Carto basemaps** (public, no auth) instead of Mapbox.

#### Failed SQL App Creation Scripts
-  `Setup/spcs_migration/00_RUN_ALL_MIGRATION_STEPS.sql`
-  `Setup/spcs_migration/03_create_streamlit_app_spcs.sql`
-  `Setup/spcs_migration/03_migrate_existing_app.sql`
-  `Setup/spcs_migration/04_create_new_app_v6.sql`

**Why:** Creating SPCS Streamlit apps via SQL doesn't work well:
- UI doesn't show SQL-created apps properly
- Git integration and stage setup isn't handled correctly
- **Must use Snowsight UI** for SPCS app creation (works perfectly!)

#### Old Documentation
-  `MIGRATION_COMPLETED.md`

**Why:** Early migration docs that are now outdated. Better docs now exist.

### 2. Updated All Documentation

#### Main README (`README.md`)
**Changes:**
-  Quick Start now shows UI-based deployment (not SQL)
-  SPCS section updated with current approach
-  All Mapbox references changed to Carto
-  External access integrations explained clearly
-  Project structure updated to show Trash folder
-  Key design decisions updated (Carto, SPCS runtime)

**Before:**
```sql
-- Old: SQL-based app creation
@Setup/spcs_migration/03_create_streamlit_app_spcs.sql
```

**After:**
```
Must create app via Snowsight UI
See CREATE_APP_IN_SNOWSIGHT.md for instructions
```

#### Quick Create Guide (`QUICK_CREATE_GUIDE.md`)
**Changes:**
-  Clarified PYPI_ACCESS_INTEGRATION purpose
-  Changed "Mapbox integration" to "Carto map tiles"
-  Added note about Carto being public (no API key)
-  Updated testing checklist to mention Carto basemap
-  Added troubleshooting reference to MAPBOX_FIX_SUMMARY.md

#### Trash Folder Documentation (`Trash/README.md`)
**Created new file:**
-  Explains what's in Trash
-  Documents why each file was obsolete
-  Points to current approach
-  Clarifies files are kept for reference, not deletion

##  Key Changes in Approach

### Deployment Method
**Before:**
-  Create app via SQL
-  Complex ROOT_LOCATION and Git stage setup
-  App not visible in Snowsight UI

**After:**
-  Create app via Snowsight UI
-  UI handles Git integration automatically
-  App immediately visible and manageable

### Map Technology
**Before:**
-  Mapbox (requires auth, complex setup)
-  Limited network rule (5 hosts)
-  API key management

**After:**
-  Carto basemaps (public, no auth)
-  Expanded network rule (19 hosts)
-  Zero configuration needed
-  Fast, reliable global CDN

### External Access
**Before:**
- Minimal documentation
- Unclear what each integration does

**After:**
-  Clear explanation in README
-  PYPI_ACCESS_INTEGRATION - for package installation
-  MAPBOX_ACCESS_INTEGRATION - for Carto tiles (misnomer but kept)
-  Visual diagram in EXTERNAL_ACCESS_DIAGRAM.md

##  Updated Terminology

| Old Term | New Term | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| "Mapbox integration" | "Carto map tiles" | Still uses MAPBOX_ACCESS_INTEGRATION name |
| "SQL app creation" | "Snowsight UI creation" | Only method that works |
| "Migration" | "Deployment" | Not migrating, deploying fresh |
| "API key" | "No API key needed" | Carto is public |

---

##  What Users Need to Know

### For New Deployments:

1. **Run setup scripts** (3 files):
   ```sql
   @Setup/spcs_migration/01_create_compute_pool.sql
   @Setup/spcs_migration/02_create_external_access_integrations.sql
   @Setup/spcs_migration/05_fix_mapbox_access.sql
   ```

2. **Create app in Snowsight UI** (not SQL):
   - Follow `CREATE_APP_IN_SNOWSIGHT.md`
   - Select "Run on container"
   - Enable both external access integrations

3. **Maps use Carto** (public basemap):
   - No API key needed
   - Automatically works with external access integration
   - Fast, reliable, free

### For Troubleshooting:

- **Maps blank?** → `MAPBOX_FIX_SUMMARY.md`
- **Build fails?** → Check PYPI_ACCESS_INTEGRATION enabled
- **App creation?** → `CREATE_APP_IN_SNOWSIGHT.md`
- **Quick reference?** → `QUICK_CREATE_GUIDE.md`

---

##  Benefits of This Cleanup

2. `QUICK_CREATE_GUIDE.md` - 5-minute quick reference

**For Detailed Deployment:**
1. `CREATE_APP_IN_SNOWSIGHT.md` - Step-by-step with screenshots
2. `Setup/spcs_migration/README_SPCS_MIGRATION.md` - Full technical guide

**For Troubleshooting:**
1. `MAPBOX_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Map issues
2. `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - General issues
3. `Setup/spcs_migration/QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - SPCS commands

**For Understanding:**
1. `SPCS_MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - Why SPCS, benefits
2. `Setup/spcs_migration/EXTERNAL_ACCESS_DIAGRAM.md` - Visual guide

---

##  Next Steps

### If you're deploying fresh:
1.  Read `README.md` Quick Start section
2.  Run the 3 setup SQL scripts
3.  Follow `CREATE_APP_IN_SNOWSIGHT.md` to create app
4.  Test maps (should show Carto background!)

### If you have an old app:
1.  Your data is already in Snowflake
2.  Just create new SPCS app via UI
3.  Enable both external access integrations
4.  Delete old warehouse-based app when ready

### If you're updating from Git:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Cleanup: Move obsolete files to Trash, update docs for Carto basemaps"
git push origin main
```
