#  Documentation Organization

**Date**: October 6, 2025  
**Action**: Reorganized markdown files for cleaner project structure

---

##  Root Directory (6 files)

Essential files that should remain easily accessible:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `README.md` | Main project documentation |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Version history and changes |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Contribution guidelines |
| `CREATE_APP_IN_SNOWSIGHT.md` | ⭐ Critical deployment guide |
| `QUICK_CREATE_GUIDE.md` | ⭐ Quick deployment reference |
| `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` | Common issues and solutions |

**Why in root?**
- Standard practice (README, CHANGELOG, CONTRIBUTING)
- Frequently accessed (deployment guides, troubleshooting)
- Easy discoverability for new users

---

##  Documentation Folder (7 files)

Detailed documentation, fix summaries, and reference materials:

### Migration & Setup Summaries
- `SPCS_MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - SPCS overview and benefits
- `CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` - Cleanup actions and rationale

### Fix & Update Documentation
- `CELL_TOWER_LOOKUP_FIX.md` - Cell Tower page indentation fixes
- `MAPBOX_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Map background fixes (Carto migration)
- `LOGO_REMOVAL_SUMMARY.md` - Sidebar logo removal details

### Reference Materials
- `ExampleQuestions.md` - Sample questions for Snowflake Intelligence
- `enhancements.md` - Enhancement roadmap

**Why in Documentation?**
- Technical details not needed daily
- Historical reference for fixes
- Keeps root directory clean
- Easily searchable when needed

---

## ️ Trash Folder (Not in Git)

Obsolete files kept for reference:

**Status**:  Added to `.gitignore`

**Contents:**
- Old SQL app creation scripts (didn't work with SPCS)
- Old Mapbox setup scripts (warehouse runtime)
- Old migration documentation (outdated)

**Purpose:**
- Local reference only
- Not pushed to repository
- Can be deleted anytime without impact
